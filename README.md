# Parties-and-Elections-Project
Semester project for Parties and Elections class, Fall 2024. In this project, classmates Tomas Utesche and Graham McFarland worked with me to investigate the association between voters' choices in presidential primaries, and their vote in the general election. In particular, we hypothesized that having supported a candidate who did not get the eventual nomination would be predictive of a voter supporting a candidate other than their party's nominee in the general election. To test this hypothesis, we crafted a question asking voters whom they did or would have supported in their party's primary, and put this question on an exit poll which we administered on Election Day at precincts around Minnesota's 2nd Congressional District. I helped to clean the data as it came in, and then we used t-tests to address our three hypotheses. 

## Deliverable

The deliverable for this project is _PSCI Elections paper 2.pdf_.

## Documents

_PSCI_Project.Rmd_ contains all of the code I wrote for this project.

The exit poll data itself is available upon request, but will be not made public for privacy reasons. 

## Packages

The statistical analysis was performed in RStudio, as was the creation of the graphs in the deliverable. I used packages _tidyverse_ and _ggmosaic_.

## Author Contributions

In addition to coming up with the hypotheses and survey question, I performed all of the RStudio work (the statistical analysis and visual creation). Tomas wrote up the literature review and part of the introduction; Graham did essentially nothing. 

My part of this assignment did not use any generative AI, and I am reasonably confident Tomas didn't either.
